# Election Analysis

## 1.	Overview of Election Audit:

 In this audit we analyzed the results of congressional election provided by Colorado Board of Elections. Doing so, we were able to determine the results of the election across three counties, Arapahoe, Denver and Jefferson, and those of the three candidates, Charles Casper Stockham, Diana DeGette and Raymon Anthony Doane. The number of registered voters who voted for their favorite candidate was *369711*. In this analysis, we calculated the total number of votes and its percentages cast for each candidate and county, aside from determining the winning candidate, and the county with the largest turn out. 
 
* For this analysis we used a Microsoft Excel file (csv) that contained the election data. We also used VSCode to write and edit the script and Python 3.8.5 (64-bit) software (part of Anaconda 3 software by May 1, 2021) for the descriptive analysis of the election data.

  
## 2.	Election-Audit Results:

o	All in all, 369,711 of votes were cast by registered voters across the three states in this congressional election (Figure 1).

o	The voting turnout was the highest in Denver with 306,055 (82.8%) votes cast.

## 3. Election-Audit Summary
 The script used in this audit can be modified to be used in similar elections with any number of voters, candidates or counties, or with any other variables to measure.
 
 ### Examples:
 1. As the script contains "for loops" created to scan through the Excel (csv) data file, it is able to retrieve any number of votes that such files could hold to determine the total number of votes cast, the votes for any number of candidates, the candidate and county with the largest number of votes (Figure 2).

 2. As the script benefits from easy to create variables, it can be refactored to include other data points of interest, such as age of the participants, their education attainments, their political affiliation and so on to better strategize for future elections by respective candidates or political parties (Figure 3).
